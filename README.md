To run all tests, execute:
```bash
php artisan test
```

### Expected Output
The tests will validate:

- Position recalculation logic.
- Input validations and unique title enforcement.

## Testing APIs

You can use tools like **Swagger**, 

-------------------------------------------

## Swagger Documentation

The API comes with a Swagger UI for exploring and testing endpoints.

### Access Swagger
Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api-documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api-documentation) after starting the server.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Errors**: Ensure the `.env` file is properly configured, and migrations have been run.
- **Validation Errors**: Check the API response messages for validation rules.
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure the necessary file permissions for Laravel (`storage/` and `bootstrap/cache`).
